print("I will now count my chickens:") #prints out text

print("Hens", 25 + 30 / 6) #prints out text followed by solving equation, giving only the result

print(3 + 2 + 1 - 5 + 4 % 2 - 1 / 4 + 6) #solves the equation

#Explanation: 3 plus 2 plus 1 minus 5 + (4 modulo 2) minus (1 divided by 4) + 6)
#modulo: divides number by number and checks if there is a rest. only hands out the rest.
